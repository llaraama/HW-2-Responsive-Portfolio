# HW-2-Responsive-Portfolio

For this homework assignment we had to build a web application that was responsive to various screen sizes. The instructions where to use Bootstraping in our HTML pages. 

* This activity helped me to learn the skill of using both Bootstraping and css at the same time. 

* how to link different HTML pages to one and build a navigation bar to be able to navigate between them

* I had the opportunity to practice making my HTML pages sematic and learned that it is better to do it as you go and not when your done
